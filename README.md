#srsly

srsly is an extremely simple URL shortener written in Sinatra. 

It's called 'srsly' because it's a domain hack that somehow hasn't been claimed yet (http://srs.ly). However, in order to register a domain less than three 
characters for the .ly TLD, you actually need some form of presence in Libya.

So, for now, it's on heroku, http://srsly.heroku.com
